# lagbuster

## Synopsis

Scientific research indicates that some of the worst effects of jet lag can be avoided by careful management of your sleep-wake cycle before, during, and after your trip. If we know your origin and destination, date of departure, direction of travel and usual bedtime we can build you a personalised sleep/wake calendar to prepare your body and mind for a healthier travel experience.

## Motivation

International travel is both a blessing and a curse - whether you're experiencing an exciting new culture on vacation or conducting business around the world, both can be ruined by jet lag. Adjusting your sleep cycle before you go can really help, and we're looking for ways to automate that process and make it easier for you to make the most of your time on the road, rather than being asleep in your hotel in the middle of the day or awake at 3 am.
